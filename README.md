# Kashf-
🛡️ An Agentic AI-powered OSINT Privacy Dashboard built for AMD Slingshot 2026. Maps digital footprints, identifies data leaks, and automates privacy takedowns using local AMD Ryzen AI NPU acceleration for 100% data privacy.
# 🛡️ Project Name: [KASHF]

### **Developed for the AMD Ryzen Slingshot 2026 National Hackathon**

## 🚀 The Vision
In an era where personal data is the new currency, **[Project Name]** empowers individuals to take back control of their digital identity. Unlike traditional OSINT tools used for tracking, our platform acts as a personal privacy auditor. It uses **Agentic AI** to scan thousands of public sources, map your digital footprint, and automate the process of "right to be forgotten" requests.

## 🧠 The "Agentic AI" Innovation
While standard tools just list links, our **Agentic AI model** (optimized for **AMD Ryzen AI**) performs autonomous reasoning:
1. **The Scout:** Intelligently discovers hidden accounts across 3000+ platforms.
2. **The Auditor:** Analyzes data clusters locally to calculate a "Privacy Threat Score."
3. **The Ghost:** Automatically generates and queues GDPR/CCPA-compliant takedown notices to data brokers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Hosting (Render):** The React frontend, FastAPI backend, and Managed PostgreSQL Database are natively deployed on Render's containerized infrastructure for robust, long-running processes.
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, **D3.js** (Interactive Footprint Mapping)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL (Render Managed Database)
- **Scouts OSINT:** BeautifulSoup4 & HTTPX (Lightweight container scraping)
- **AI/ML (Local Privacy):** Agentic LLM Architecture. While the web dashboard is hosted on Render, the "Hackathon Winning Feature" (Local LLM privacy analysis via `llama-cpp-python` and auto-wiping loops) executes continuously to guarantee 100% data privacy.
- **Security:** OAuth 2.0 Identity Verification
