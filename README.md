# Kashf-
🛡️ An Agentic AI-powered OSINT Privacy Dashboard built for AMD Slingshot 2026. Maps digital footprints, identifies data leaks, and automates privacy takedowns using local AMD Ryzen AI NPU acceleration for 100% data privacy.
# 🛡️ Project Name: [KASHF]

### **Developed for the AMD Ryzen Slingshot 2026 National Hackathon**

## 🚀 The Vision
In an era where personal data is the new currency, **[Project Name]** empowers individuals to take back control of their digital identity. Unlike traditional OSINT tools used for tracking, our platform acts as a personal privacy auditor. It uses **Agentic AI** to scan thousands of public sources, map your digital footprint, and automate the process of "right to be forgotten" requests.

## 🧠 The "Agentic AI" Innovation
While standard tools just list links, our **Agentic AI model** (optimized for **AMD Ryzen AI**) performs autonomous reasoning:
1. **The Scout:** Intelligently discovers hidden accounts across 3000+ platforms.
2. **The Auditor:** Analyzes data clusters locally to calculate a "Privacy Threat Score."
3. **The Ghost:** Automatically generates and queues GDPR/CCPA-compliant takedown notices to data brokers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Hosting (Vercel):** The React frontend and FastAPI backend are deployed on Vercel's serverless infrastructure for global reach and high availability.
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, **D3.js** (Interactive Footprint Mapping)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres/Supabase)
- **Scouts OSINT:** BeautifulSoup4 & HTTPX (Optimized for Serverless Execution)
- **AI/ML (Local Privacy):** Agentic LLM Architecture running entirely on **AMD Ryzen™ AI Hardware**. While the web app is hosted on Vercel, the "Hackathon Winning Feature" (Local LLM privacy analysis) executes solely on the user's local hardware to guarantee 100% data privacy.
- **Security:** OAuth 2.0 Identity Verification
